# asphalt9_OpenCV_Simulation

# Set-up

You need to have Python3, OpenCV and Asphalt 9 installed in your PC to make this work locally.

For the computer vision part a red glove would be needed to track motion. Try to get the shade as close to mine for smooth performance or tweek the 'hsv' value to match your glove.

The green paper attached at the back was used for clicking 'enter' for option selection. You'll need a similar green paper to activate the enter command.
